On 4th-6th December 2018 we were invited to participate in consultative meeting of the Council of Europe, at the European Youth Center in Budapest, Hungary.

The aim of the Consultative Meeting:
* gather recommendations “on areas for further research and development necessary for the quality and consistency of the educational approaches of the European Youth Centre”
* explore “past and current approaches towards intercultural learning and non‐formal education”
* explore quality standards and their application in the activities of the European Youth Center

EDP contributed by sharing innovative research method and impact assessment tools used in the area of intercultural learning and non-formal education to make training sessions more effective and efficient.

The issues discussed included:

* how to connect non-formal education and evaluation methods
the importance of defining the needs of people participating in non-formal education
