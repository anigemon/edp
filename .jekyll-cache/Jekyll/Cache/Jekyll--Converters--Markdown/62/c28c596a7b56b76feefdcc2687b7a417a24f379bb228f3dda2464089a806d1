I"><p>'’So, how will you measure the relationship between x and y?’’</p>

<p>You might ask. Therefore, we want to give you a taste of the methodology we will use while evaluating the work of your organization. Statistics and statistical methods can be “dirty” and complicated, but ultimately they help us to understand the processes that surround us and “create” a more tangible world. Don’t be afraid to step into the world of statistics with us!</p>

<h2 id="sample-matching">Sample matching</h2>

<p>Okay, let me try to sum this up. Sample matching stands for pairing participants that have all the same characteristics except for one. Usually this is used to create a treatment group and a control group within the sample. In a nutshell, the purpose of this technique is to get more reliable statistics by controlling for the effects of “unwanted variables.” For example, imagine that you are investigating the health effects of smoking and you can control for age-related effects by matching participants that are of the same age. Sounds like a more reliable method, doesn’t it?</p>

<h2 id="natural-language-processing">Natural Language Processing</h2>

<p>When trying to picture what natural language processing really means, think of how computer programs and algorithms assist in the analysis of human-written texts. If there are hundreds of pages you want to analyze and look for certain patterns,  it would be rather burdensome to skim through the pages all by yourself. This is when the algorithms take over! For example, imagine that we are looking for the racial attitudes of participants in a certain study. They are asked to write 15 sentences on a similar scenario, but one is with a member of their own ethnicity, while the other is with an outgroup member (e.g.: a fight with someone at a supermarket because they passed you in a long queue.)  Then we will analyze their response for a variety of factors, such as the application of negatives versus positive terms, sentiment analysis and stereotypical constructions. This will help us to gain an in-depth understand of the participants’ attitudes towards different cultures and ethnicities.</p>

<h2 id="implicit-association-test-iat">Implicit Association Test (IAT)</h2>

<p>So, what does IAT really stand for? We basically measure the strength of someone’s automatic association between concepts, or between concepts and pictures for example. Let’s imagine that we are testing for prejudice against women! We have two lists of words: one that contains negative descriptions (e.g.: pain, dumb, etc) and on with positive ones (e.g.: joy, intelligent, etc.) Then we have images of males and females, and both the words and images are set to flash up on a computer screen. The participants have to associate the words with the images, and their response time is recorded. In theory, quick and accurate responses are given when the task is compatible with the participant’s preference (e.g.: female and dumb), but the pairing is slow when the participant is faced with incompatible preferences ( female and intelligent.) Or in other words, the longer it takes to pair two things up, the greater our bias!</p>

<h2 id="regression-discontinuity-design">Regression Discontinuity Design</h2>

<p>“Regression Discontinuity Design”? Uff, a rather ugly name. However, this method is about as “ugly” as it is useful in political science, but also in evaluating policy implementation. In scientific terms, the RD approach is considered as one form of conducting an experiment due to the lack of the ability to conduct “natural experiments.” But let me describe how it is used to evaluate the impact of certain policies.</p>

<p>Consider a programme (at the EU level for example) to support the job search of unemployed workers, 25 years old or younger. So, how do we test the extent to which the programme is effective? When conducting RDD the key is to create a threshold, therefore we look at individuals who are slightly below and slightly above the age of 25. We create Group 1 which consists of unemployed people between the age of 23 and 24 that have participated in the program. Then Group 2, consisting  of unemployed people between the age of 26 and 27 that have not participated . In theory these groups should be very similar (e.g.: demography, education, income), except for their participation in the program. The difference between the average unemployment rates between the two groups (or in other words the RDD estimate) can hence be associated with their participation in the given training. This makes RDD (also called as counterfactual impact evaluation) a powerful design to evaluate the impact of policies and improve their implementation.</p>
