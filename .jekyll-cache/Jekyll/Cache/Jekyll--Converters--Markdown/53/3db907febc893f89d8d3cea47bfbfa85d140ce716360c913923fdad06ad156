I"c<p>Today, we know that traditional evaluation of corporate social performance (CSP) is ridden with methodological issues, the biggest one being <em>endogeneity</em>. Though a big word, it reflects a simple underlying issue: we measure and see what we want to see. We know that in your every action you seek performance and impact. Problem is, our surveys provide us with the answers we seek, our questionnaires prove us right and our social projects seem to succeed. And stakeholders know this: while CSP is quintessential for long-term value creation, your shareholders and investors are aware of these issues, and hence your social investment will not provide the returns expected. Successful CSP hinges on credibility. We will build it together.</p>
